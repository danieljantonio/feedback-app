## Task

Task: Based off the attached screenshot, create a page that allows someone to add "feedback/reviews". When a person clicks on a "Add review" button, a dialog will appear allowing them to type a message (textarea), and three options from 1 - 5 (communication, item, value). This should then be persisted to a back-end API / database. For the person avatar/name - this can simply be dummy values.

- [ ] Create a page that allows to add "feedback/reviews"
- [ ] Click "Add review" -> Dialog for users to add their review
  - [ ] Type a message (textarea)
  - [ ] Three options to rate from 1 - 5 (communication, item, value)
- [ ] Reviews should be persisted to the database.

For tech stack:

- Front end: NextJS, React, MUI
- Back end: NestJS, Prisma

MUI contains some components that you can re-use so that you shouldn't need to build it out yourself.

- https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/
- https://mui.com/material-ui/react-dialog/

![UI Reference](https://github.com/danieljantonio/feedback-app/blob/main/ui-reference.jpg?raw=true)

What I may recommend is that, implement the basic UI first, and load the data from an API (as dummy / mock data). Then proceed ahead with the dialog and adding of new reviews into the database
